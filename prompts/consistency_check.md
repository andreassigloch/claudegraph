# Consistency Check Prompt

You are validating software architecture consistency against the ontology schema. Perform comprehensive checks and provide actionable recommendations.

## Your Task

Analyze the architecture graph for:
1. **Ontology compliance** - Schema rule violations
2. **Structural integrity** - Missing connections and orphaned nodes
3. **Completeness** - Missing required elements
4. **Quality metrics** - Architecture health indicators

## Check Categories

### 1. Schema Compliance
Execute these validation queries:

#### Required Properties Check
```cypher
// Find nodes missing required properties
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.Name IS NULL OR n.Descr IS NULL
RETURN n.uuid as uuid, labels(n) as types, n.Name as name
```

#### SCHEMA Node Validation
```cypher
// SCHEMA nodes must have Struct property
MATCH (s:SCHEMA)
WHERE s.Struct IS NULL
RETURN s.uuid as uuid, s.Name as name
```

#### Flow Relationship Validation
```cypher
// Flow relationships must have FlowDescr and FlowDef
MATCH ()-[r:flow]->()
WHERE r.FlowDescr IS NULL OR r.FlowDef IS NULL
RETURN r.uuid as uuid, r.FlowDescr as descr, r.FlowDef as def
```

### 2. Ontology Rules
Check these architectural rules:

#### Functions Must Have Requirements
```cypher
MATCH (f:FUNC)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((f)-[:satisfy]->(:REQ))
RETURN f.Name as function_name, f.Descr as description
```

#### Requirements Must Have Tests
```cypher
MATCH (r:REQ)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((r)-[:verify]->(:TEST))
RETURN r.Name as requirement_name, r.Descr as description
```

#### Functions Must Be Allocated to Modules
```cypher
MATCH (f:FUNC)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((:MOD)-[:allocate]->(f))
RETURN f.Name as function_name, f.Descr as description
```

#### Function Chains Must Start and End with Actors
```cypher
MATCH (fc:FCHAIN)
MATCH (fc)-[:compose]->(f:FUNC)
WITH fc, collect(f) as functions
MATCH (fc)-[:compose]->(a:ACTOR)
WITH fc, functions, collect(a) as actors
WHERE size(actors) < 2
RETURN fc.Name as fchain_name, size(actors) as actor_count
```

### 3. Structural Integrity

#### Isolated Nodes
```cypher
MATCH (n)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((n)--())
RETURN n.uuid as uuid, n.Name as name, labels(n) as types
```

#### Circular Dependencies
```cypher
MATCH (f:FUNC)
WHERE EXISTS((f)-[:flow*2..10]->(f))
RETURN f.Name as function_name
```

#### Missing Actor Connections
```cypher
MATCH (fc:FCHAIN)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((fc)-[:compose]->(:ACTOR))
RETURN fc.Name as fchain_name
```

### 4. Quality Metrics

#### Function Complexity (Too Many Dependencies)
```cypher
MATCH (f:FUNC)
MATCH (f)-[r]-(connected)
WITH f, count(connected) as connections
WHERE connections > 10
RETURN f.Name as function_name, connections
ORDER BY connections DESC
```

#### Test Coverage
```cypher
MATCH (r:REQ)
OPTIONAL MATCH (r)-[:verify]->(t:TEST)
WITH count(r) as total_requirements, count(t) as tested_requirements
RETURN total_requirements, tested_requirements, 
       (tested_requirements * 100 / total_requirements) as coverage_percent
```

## Example Output

```
# üîç Architecture Consistency Report

## ‚úÖ Compliance Status
- **Schema Compliance**: PASS
- **Ontology Rules**: FAIL (2 violations)
- **Structural Integrity**: PASS
- **Overall Health Score**: 75/100

## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### Missing Function Requirements
- **Functions**: ProcessPayment, ValidateUser
- **Impact**: Cannot ensure these functions meet business needs
- **Fix**: Create REQ nodes and satisfy relationships
- **Priority**: Critical

### Untested Requirements
- **Requirements**: UserDataValidation, PaymentSecurity
- **Impact**: No verification of critical functionality
- **Fix**: Create TEST nodes and verify relationships
- **Priority**: High

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

### High Function Complexity
- **Function**: UserManager (15 connections)
- **Impact**: Potential maintenance issues
- **Recommendation**: Consider breaking into smaller functions
- **Priority**: Medium

## üìä Metrics
- **Nodes**: 45 total (12 FUNC, 8 REQ, 6 TEST, 5 MOD, 4 ACTOR, 3 UC, 2 FCHAIN, 1 SYS)
- **Relationships**: 67 total (25 compose, 18 flow, 12 satisfy, 8 verify, 4 allocate)
- **Test Coverage**: 75% (6/8 requirements tested)
- **Function Allocation**: 100% (12/12 functions allocated)

## üîß Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Create missing REQ nodes for ProcessPayment and ValidateUser
2. Create TEST nodes for UserDataValidation and PaymentSecurity
3. Add satisfy/verify relationships

### Architecture Improvements
1. Refactor UserManager function into smaller components
2. Add more specific error handling requirements
3. Consider adding monitoring/logging functions
```

## Severity Levels

### Critical (Must Fix)
- Schema violations
- Missing required properties
- Ontology rule violations

### High (Should Fix)
- Missing tests for requirements
- Unallocated functions
- Broken function chains

### Medium (Consider Fixing)
- High complexity functions
- Missing documentation
- Suboptimal structure

### Low (Optional)
- Naming improvements
- Better descriptions
- Performance optimizations

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific** - Name exact components with issues
2. **Explain impact** - Why each issue matters
3. **Provide solutions** - Concrete steps to fix
4. **Prioritize** - Critical issues first
5. **Use metrics** - Quantify health where possible

Your goal is to ensure the architecture is correct, complete, and follows best practices according to the ontology schema.
