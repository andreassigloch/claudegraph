# ClaudeGraph Efficiency Optimizations

## Current Performance Issue
- **35.6k tokens, 16 tool uses, 1m 54s** for impact analysis
- Multiple separate queries instead of consolidated ones
- Function-level details in initial architecture (too granular)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Query Consolidation
**Before**: 3 separate queries (direct, transitive, tests)
**After**: Single comprehensive query
**Reduction**: 67% fewer database calls

### 2. High-Level Abstraction Only
**Focus on**: SYS → UC → ACTOR → FCHAIN → SCHEMA
**Exclude**: Individual FUNC nodes (1,181 functions!)
**Rationale**: Initial architecture needs strategic view, not implementation details

### 3. Result Set Limits
- Direct impacts: 5 max (was unlimited)
- Transitive impacts: 5 max (was 20)
- Affected tests: 3 max (was unlimited)

### 4. Pre-Cached Patterns
Common queries (flows, actors, chains) cached as templates
**Reduction**: ~90% tokens for repeated patterns

### 5. Efficient Cypher Patterns
```cypher
// EFFICIENT: Single query with limits
MATCH (target)-[r1]-(direct)
WHERE labels(direct)[0] IN ['UC', 'ACTOR', 'FCHAIN', 'SCHEMA']
WITH collect(DISTINCT direct)[0..5] as limited_direct

// INEFFICIENT: Multiple queries, no limits
MATCH (target)-[r1]-(direct) RETURN direct
MATCH (target)-[*2..3]-(transitive) RETURN transitive
MATCH (target)-[*1..3]-(test) RETURN test
```

## Expected Performance Gains
- **Token usage**: 35.6k → ~10k (70% reduction)
- **Tool calls**: 16 → 4-5 (75% reduction)
- **Time**: 1m 54s → ~30s (75% reduction)

## Implementation Priority
1. **Update impact analysis** to use single consolidated query
2. **Cache common patterns** to avoid repeated processing
3. **Limit result sets** to essential high-level components
4. **Focus on UC/ACTOR/FCHAIN/SCHEMA** for initial architecture

## High-Level Architecture Focus
```
SYS "GraphManagementApp"
├── UC: 10 use cases (API, Billing, Collaboration, etc.)
├── ACTOR: 10 actors (WebClient, Database, Cache, etc.)
├── FCHAIN: 8 chains (User Auth, Graph Edit, etc.)
└── SCHEMA: 10 interfaces (User, Graph, Node, etc.)
```

**Skip for initial architecture**: 1,181 individual functions, detailed requirements, granular tests

This keeps the architecture at the strategic level while maintaining full ontology compliance.
