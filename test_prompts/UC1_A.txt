You are working on the AssistantTestClaude project at /Users/andreas/Documents/Tools/VSCode/AssistantTestClaude.

Your task is to complete the following:

Please update the visualization_assistant function in src/assistant/llm_tools/visualization_assistant.py to accept a new optional field 'chart_type' in its input. The field should:
1. Be an optional string that defaults to 'bar' if not provided
2. Be added to the VisualizationRequest schema/interface
3. Be used in the visualization generation logic

Make sure to update all places where VisualizationRequest is used to handle this new field.

Please implement this task. Show me what files you're searching and what changes you're making.
