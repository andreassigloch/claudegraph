You are working on the AssistantTestClaude project at /Users/andreas/Documents/Tools/VSCode/AssistantTestClaude.

Your task is to complete the following:

Add a new function called 'process_user_feedback' that stores user ratings (1-5 stars) for query results. This function should:
1. Be integrated into the GraphQuery flow
2. Be called after FormatResults but before returning the response
3. Accept a rating (1-5) and the query result
4. Store the feedback in the database

Update the flow to include this new step and implement the function.

Please implement this task. Show me what files you're searching and what changes you're making.
