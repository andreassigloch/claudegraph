You are working on the AssistantTestClaude project at /Users/andreas/Documents/Tools/VSCode/AssistantTestClaude.

Your task is to complete the following:

Update the function that handles Neo4j query execution to add caching:
1. Find the main function that executes Cypher queries
2. Implement a simple in-memory cache that stores results for 5 minutes
3. Use query string as cache key
4. Add cache hit/miss logging

The cache should improve performance for repeated queries.

Please implement this task. Show me what files you're searching and what changes you're making.
