# ClaudeGraph v3 Requirements
# Author: Andreas Sigloch (andreas@siglochconsulting.com)
# Minimal dependencies for markdown-based architectural compliance

# No dependencies required!
# ClaudeGraph v3 uses only:
# - Markdown files (flow.md)
# - Claude's native vector search
# - Claude Code's built-in file operations

# Optional development tools (if you want to contribute):
# black>=23.0.0         # Code formatting
# pytest>=7.0.0         # Testing framework

# Note: ClaudeGraph v3 intentionally has zero runtime dependencies
# This is part of the "ultra-simple" design philosophy
